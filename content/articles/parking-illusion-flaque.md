Here is a somewhat special article that deviates from my usual editorial habits.

Last June, after an evening with my company ([Talents Night](https://www.altran.com/fr/fr/talents-nights-altran-rencontre-plus-de-1000-ingenieurs-juniors/), on June 12), I left the parking lot of the Museum of Modern Art in Strasbourg.

And I came across this very embarrassing situation! I stopped my vehicle abruptly to avoid falling into the hole... which wasn't one!

Can you find the exit?

I really amazed my friends and colleagues by showing them this photo!

This situation was so crazy! Should we go left? Right? Up? Or down?

Here is the same shot but much wider (with my little car! #toyota #hybrid)

I am writing this article to prove that I am indeed the author of this photo. It went viral on social media, appearing on [Huffington Post](https://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2018/06/18/cette-illusion-d-optique-va-vous-empecher-de-sortir-du-parking_a_23461536/), [Glamour Paris](https://www.glamourparis.com/culture/toutes-des-geeks/articles/illusion-doptique-internet-tente-desesperement-de-sortir-dun-parking/65446), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/MichelEdi/posts/10218489901462550), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/adteew/this_surreal_puddle_in_a_parking_garage/) (and its [many reposts](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/adteew/this_surreal_puddle_in_a_parking_garage/edk7paq/)), and Twitter:
