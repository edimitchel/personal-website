There it is, my new webpage. 

Not only a new page but also a new step for my professional life.

# New professional life

## Bye bye employee life

For several years of employment, I was pleased to have a frame around to keep me in a job security. After my long journey with Altran (then Capgemini Engineering), I quit for a new challenge near my home but also to be more openly able to start my own business aside my job (which wasn't the case before). The new company is France Solar.

During my new job, I was working for web technologies I love but didn't had the opportunity to work professionally: **Vue.js**.

My individual company was officially created the same day I start my new job, what a coincidence.

> For the joke, my first mission I had – which kickstart my enterprise creation – was given by my N-2 ex-manager.

Few months after my new job, I met Ferdinand from NuxtLabs during the Vue Amsterdam conference (the day of my birthday in 2024) which kickstart my Nuxt Expert journey. What an opportunity for me to empower my new job with Nuxt and doing consulting again but with a framework I love.

### First missions

First mission came quickly in April, and then, another one in June, an so one after another. *Take a look to my projects to see what I've been working on.*

As my employment takes my day, I had to work on my projects at home during evenings and weekends. I limited my week hours work to 16 hours for health and legal reasons. As a dad of 2 children, I needed to be available and healthy for them.

Those missions are not frequent enough to make it a full time job, but it's fine.

### France Solar end 

Something changed in all that stuff: France Solar wasn't in a good shape and its end was close. Yes, my job ends one year and a half after I start it. What a shame but also what an opportunity to work on my business full-time.

## Hello full-independence life

Since July 2025, I have officially only my business as a professional loan. It sounds scary when you put it like that but it's not that bad. A friend of mine helped me to work on a 6-months contract which starts **today**.

# New website

I've been meaning to do this for a while now, and finally found the time to make it happen. It's a simple, modern, and responsive design that I'm proud of. I hope you like it.

As an Nuxt Expert, I couldn't use another framework than Nuxt. Especially I wanted something simple to edit content using markdown thus an accessible editor to let me update the content from any terminal.

Also, what I really want is to make my content available in all languages I speak, French (my native one) and English.

Today, AI is everywhere, I decide to use Mistral API to automatically translate content on creation or retranslate it on demand. Any new content translated is submitted to a review using PRs. Then when merge, translated content arrives into the french version.

I choose to write new content in English not in French as I'm used to.
