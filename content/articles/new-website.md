There it is, my new webpage. I've been meaning to do this for a while now, and finally found the time to make it happen. It's a simple, modern, and responsive design that I'm proud of. I hope you like it.

Not only a new page but also a new step for my professional life by becoming a fullstack developer freelancer.

As an Nuxt Expert, I couldn't use another framework than Nuxt. Especially I wanted something simple to edit content using markdown thus an accessible editor to let me update the content from any terminal.

Also, what I really want is to make my content available in all languages I speak, French (my native one) and English. As for today, AI is present everywhere, I decide to use Mistral API to automatically translate content on creation or retranslate it on demand.
