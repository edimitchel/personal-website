There it is, my new webpage.

Not only a new webpage but also a new step for my professional life.

# New professional life

## Bye bye employee life

For several years of employment, I was pleased to have a frame around to keep me in a job security. After my long journey with Altran (then Capgemini Engineering), I quit for a new challenge near my home but also to be more openly able to start my own business aside my job (which wasn't the case before). So I join France Solar as technical tech leader.

During this new job, I was working with web technologies that I love and that I hadn't had the opportunity to use professionally before: **Vue.js**.

The official creation of my company was the same day I started my job at France Solar, what a coincidence.

> Another coincidence, my first mission – which kickstart my enterprise creation – was given by my N+2 ex-manager.

Few months after, I met Ferdinand from NuxtLabs during the Vue Amsterdam conference (the day of my birthday in 2024). This meeting kickstarted my Nuxt Expert journey. What an opportunity for me to empower my new job with Nuxt and doing consulting again but with a framework I love.

### First consulting missions

First mission came quickly in April, and then, another one in June, an so one after another. *Take a look to my projects to see what I've been working on.*

As my employment takes most of my day, I had to work on my projects at home during evenings and weekends. I limited my week hours work to 16 hours for health and legal reasons. As a dad of 2 children, I needed to be available and healthy for them.

Those missions are not frequent enough to make it a full-time job, but it's fine, it paid the renovation of my house (haha).

### France Solar sunset

Something changed in my situation: France Solar wasn't in a good shape and its end was close. Yes, my job ended one year and a half after I start it. What a shame but also what an opportunity to work on my business full-time.

## Hello full-independence life

Since July 2025, I have officially only my business as a professional loan. It sounds scary when you put it like that but it's not that bad. A friend of mine helped me to work on a minimum 6-months contract which starts **today**.

I'm still available for Nuxt consulting but since [NuxtLabs acquisition by Vercel](https://vercel.com/blog/nuxtlabs-joins-vercel), missions are done directly with me, **so if you have need help for audit, for migration or anything else, don't hesitate to contact me**.

# Hello new website

I've been meaning to do this for a while now, and finally found the time to make it happen. It's a simple, modern, and responsive design that I'm proud of. I hope you like it.

## Nuxt ecosystem with Nuxt Studio

As an Nuxt Expert, I couldn't use another framework than Nuxt. Especially I wanted something simple to edit content using markdown thus an accessible editor to let me update the content from any terminal.

Also, what I really want is to make my content available in all languages I speak, French (my native one) and English.

I was very happy to see that [Nuxt Studio will be open-sourced](https://nuxtlabs.com) since NuxtLabs acquisition. This will help me to help its development and make it even better (i.e. built-in internationalization, customization, ...).

Also, I'm using Nuxt Hub for hosting. For the moment, only for the database (for Nuxt Content) and for the deployment. Stay tuned for more features!

## AI-powered content translation

Today, AI is everywhere, I decide to use Mistral API to automatically translate content on creation or retranslate it on demand. Any new content translated is submitted to a review using PRs. Then when merged, translated content arrives into the french version.

I choose to write new content in English not in French as I'm used to.

# Future plans

Since I'm now independant, I would like to share more about my work and my experiments. So, expect more articles, projects, and experiments in the future.

I keep legacy blog post from older web page, but only in french
